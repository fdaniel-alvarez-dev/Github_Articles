AI-Powered Systems with CQRS + Event Sourcing
"How to architect low-latency, scalable APIs for LLM-powered media and entertainment applications at StreamOasis."

🎬 Why CQRS + Event Sourcing Matter for StreamOasis
StreamOasis operates in high-demand, real-time environments like: ✅ Streaming (Peacock) → Personalized content recommendations in milliseconds.
✅ Theme Parks → AI-driven ride reservations & guest interactions.
✅ Live Events → Real-time data processing for interactive experiences.
Challenges:
    • Handling massive traffic spikes (e.g., Super Bowl streaming, Olympics).
    • Low-latency API responses (e.g., AI-powered movie recommendations).
    • Event-driven architecture (ensuring consistency across multiple cloud services).
Solution: Implement CQRS + Event Sourcing with FastAPI, Kafka, and PostgreSQL, ensuring real-time updates and fault tolerance.

📜 1️⃣ CQRS + Event Sourcing Explained
🔥 Why This Matters
    • CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates writes (commands) and reads (queries) for high-performance APIs.
    • Event Sourcing ensures a historical event log, making it ideal for AI-driven systems (e.g., tracking user content preferences over time).

    User-->|Writes| CommandAPI

    EventStoreDB-->|Replicates| ReadDB
    ReadDB-->|Reads| QueryAPI
    QueryAPI-->|Returns Data| User

⚡ 2️⃣ Implementing CQRS API with FastAPI
🛠️ Command Side (Writes)
from fastapi import FastAPI
from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json

app = FastAPI()
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092",
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode("utf-8"),
)

@app.post("/recommend")
async def recommend_movie(user_id: str, genre: str):
    """Sends a movie recommendation request event to Kafka"""
    event = {"user_id": user_id, "genre": genre, "event_type": "recommend_request"}
    producer.send("recommendations", event)
    return {"message": "Recommendation request received!"}

🔹 Writes user preferences to Kafka for event-driven processing.

🛠️ Query Side (Reads)
from fastapi import FastAPI
import psycopg2

app = FastAPI()
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=read_db user=admin password=secret")

@app.get("/recommendations/{user_id}")
async def get_recommendations(user_id: str):
    """Fetches AI-generated movie recommendations for a user"""
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT recommendations FROM user_recommendations WHERE user_id = %s", (user_id,))
    data = cursor.fetchone()
    return {"user_id": user_id, "recommendations": data}

🔹 Queries the read-optimized PostgreSQL database for fast responses.

📡 3️⃣ Processing AI-Generated Events with Kafka
🛠️ Event Consumer (Processing AI Requests)
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json
import openai

consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    "recommendations",
    bootstrap_servers="localhost:9092",
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode("utf-8")),
)

def process_event(event):
    """Calls LLM API to generate movie recommendations"""
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Recommend a {event['genre']} movie"}],
    )
    print(f"Recommendation for {event['user_id']}: {response.choices[0].message.content}")

for message in consumer:
    process_event(message.value)

🔹 Processes recommendation requests in real-time, invoking LLM APIs.

📊 4️⃣ Monitoring API Performance with Prometheus + CloudWatch
🔥 Why This Matters
    • Detects API failures in real-time (e.g., missing events, slow responses).
    • Optimizes AI API calls (monitoring LLM token usage to reduce costs).

🛠️ Prometheus Metrics for Kafka Event Processing
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Counter

events_processed = Counter("events_processed", "Number of AI events processed")

def process_event(event):
    """Processes AI event and increments Prometheus counter"""
    events_processed.inc()
    # AI API logic…

🔹 Exports Kafka event metrics to Prometheus.
🔹 Next Step: Run Prometheus locally
docker run -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus

🔗 Deploying to AWS Lambda (Serverless CQRS API)
🔥 Why This Matters
    • Auto-scales AI recommendation workloads (pay-per-execution model).
    • Eliminates infrastructure maintenance costs.

🛠️ AWS Lambda Deployment with Serverless Framework
service: ai-recommendations
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.9

functions:
  recommend:
    handler: app.recommend_movie
    events:
      - http:
          path: recommend
          method: post

🔹 Deploys AI-powered CQRS API to AWS Lambda.
🔹 Next Step: Deploy using Serverless Framework
serverless deploy

🔥 Pro Tips: Optimizing CQRS for AI APIs
✅ Reduce LLM token costs → Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) instead of full API calls.
✅ Optimize read latency → Use Redis caching for frequent queries.
✅ Event replay support → Store events in Kafka + EventStoreDB for backfilling AI models.

💡 How Would You Use CQRS for StreamOasis?
This architecture can power personalized content, AI chatbots, and real-time analytics for Peacock, Universal Studios, and sports streaming.
🔹 Would you integrate Kafka or a different message broker?
🔹 How would you optimize LLM calls to minimize cloud costs?
🔹 Could this scale to handle real-time analytics for OASIS’s live events?

📢 Next Steps
🔹 Clone the Repo & Deploy: [GitHub Repo Link]
