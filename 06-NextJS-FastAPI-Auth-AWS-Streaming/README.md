🚀 Next.js + FastAPI: Auth, AWS Lambda & Real-Time Streaming

"Building scalable AI-powered media apps for the next generation of streaming and entertainment."
1️⃣ Secure AI APIs with JWT Auth & Refresh Tokens
🔥 Why This Matters for AI Engineering

    Protects AI-generated content (e.g., LLM-powered recommendations on Peacock).
    Prevents unauthorized API access in high-traffic streaming applications.
    Implements refresh token rotation to maintain long-lived sessions securely.

💡 Key Innovation

Uses JWT + refresh tokens for scalable, serverless authentication, reducing latency in cloud-native AI deployments.
🛠️ Implementation Highlights

from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer
import jwt

app = FastAPI()
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

SECRET_KEY = "OASIS_SECRET_KEY"

def verify_token(token: str):
    """Decode and validate JWT token"""
    try:
        return jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Token expired")

@app.get("/secure-data")
async def secure_endpoint(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    user = verify_token(token)
    return {"message": "Secure data access granted", "user": user}

    Deploy this as an AWS Lambda function with API Gateway authentication.

2️⃣ Streaming AI Responses with Next.js & FastAPI
🔥 Why This Matters for AI Engineering

    Enables real-time AI-generated captions (e.g., live events like the Olympics).
    Improves user experience by dynamically loading AI-generated text.
    Optimized for low-latency inference requests from LLMs.

💡 Key Innovation

Implements token streaming from LLMs for real-time AI-generated captions and subtitles in media applications.
🛠️ Implementation Highlights

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import time

app = FastAPI()

async def stream_llm_response():
    """Simulates an AI-generated response being streamed token by token"""
    for word in ["Welcome", "to", "StreamOasis!", "Enjoy", "your", "show!"]:
        yield word + " "
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate AI processing delay

@app.get("/stream")
async def get_stream():
    return StreamingResponse(stream_llm_response(), media_type="text/plain")

    Run this FastAPI endpoint in AWS Lambda to stream AI responses in real-time.

3️⃣ Fullstack CI/CD with Next.js, FastAPI & Vercel
🔥 Why This Matters for AI Engineering

    Automates end-to-end deployment of AI-powered applications.
    Ensures LLM APIs are tested before deployment (unit + integration tests).
    Uses Vercel for Next.js and GitHub Actions for FastAPI.

🔥 FAQ: Debugging AI APIs

    Why does my FastAPI app take too long to respond?
        Optimize cold starts by using AWS Lambda provisioned concurrency.
    How do I handle LLM rate limits in production?
        Implement token bucket throttling with Redis.
    Can I secure AI APIs from unauthorized use?
        Use JWT authentication with refresh tokens to prevent token reuse.
