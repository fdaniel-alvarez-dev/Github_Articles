🤖 Enterprise ML Integration: Deploying LLMs at NBCUniversal Scale
"Building AI-powered APIs that scale across TV, film, and theme parks!"
🎬 Business Context: AI in NBCUniversal
Machine learning at NBCUniversal drives: ✅ Real-time personalization (Peacock’s AI-powered recommendations).
✅ Smart content tagging (Auto-generating metadata for Bravo, USA Network, SYFY).
✅ AI chatbots for theme parks (Dynamic ride recommendations based on guest behavior).
🔹 Challenge: Deploy LLM-powered APIs while ensuring **scalability, compliance, and low latency (<200ms) across millions of users._
🔹 Solution: Use LangChain + Hugging Face + FastAPI, deployed via TensorFlow Serving & AWS Lambda.

🧑‍💻 ML Model Integration in APIs
This API serves real-time LLM-based ride recommendations for theme park guests.
1️⃣ LangChain-Powered Theme Park Chatbot
📌 Key Features:
    • Uses LangChain for LLM-powered conversations.
    • Fetches ride recommendations based on guest preferences.
    • Calls a Hugging Face model endpoint for AI inference.
📜 FastAPI Service with LangChain
from fastapi import FastAPI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceEndpoint
import os

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/recommend-ride/{guest_id}")
async def recommend_ride(guest_id: str):
    """Recommends a theme park ride based on guest preferences."""
    llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
        endpoint_url="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/NBCUniversal-ride-recommender",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY')}"}
    )
    
    chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt="What is the best ride for a guest who loves adventure?")
    return {"guest_id": guest_id, "recommended_ride": chain.run()}

🔹 LangChain-powered recommendation API.
🔹 Fetches real-time ride suggestions from a Hugging Face model.
2️⃣ Scaling Model Deployment with TensorFlow Serving
📌 Why TensorFlow Serving?
    • High-performance model serving optimized for low-latency inference.
    • Supports batching and versioned models for A/B testing.
📜 TensorFlow Model Deployment
# Convert Hugging Face model to TensorFlow SavedModel format
from transformers import AutoModel
import tensorflow as tf

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("NBCUniversal-ride-recommender")
tf.saved_model.save(model, "/models/ride_recommender")

# Start TensorFlow Serving
docker run -p 8501:8501 --name=tf_serving \
  -v "/models/ride_recommender:/models/ride_recommender" \
  -e MODEL_NAME=ride_recommender \
  tensorflow/serving

🔹 Serves LLM recommendations at scale.
🔹 Enables versioning for AI model A/B testing.

3️⃣ Secure & Scalable Cloud Deployment (AWS Lambda)
📌 Why AWS Lambda?
    • Auto-scales based on API demand.
    • Reduces cloud costs by running inference only when needed.
📜 Serverless FastAPI Deployment (AWS Lambda)
# Install required dependencies
pip install mangum fastapi

# Create FastAPI handler for AWS Lambda
from fastapi import FastAPI
from mangum import Mangum

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "AI-powered theme park API"}

handler = Mangum(app)

🔹 Deploys LLM-powered inference on AWS Lambda.
🔹 Optimized for cost-effective AI deployment.

4️⃣ Observability & Monitoring
📌 Why Prometheus & Grafana?
    • Tracks API latency, request volume, and LLM inference times.
    • Ensures AI model performance stays within SLA limits (<200ms).
📜 Prometheus Metrics for AI Inference

from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary

REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')

@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics():
    return {"latency": REQUEST_TIME.observe(0.15)}

🔹 Monitors LLM response time for performance optimization.

🚀 Key Takeaways
✅ LangChain + Hugging Face → Seamless LLM integration for theme park AI chatbots.
✅ TensorFlow Serving + AWS Lambda → Scalable, low-latency ML inference.
✅ Prometheus + Grafana → AI observability for enterprise reliability.

📢 Next Steps
🔹 Clone the Repo & Test AI Recommendations: [GitHub Repo Link]
🔹 Run a Hugging Face Model Locally:
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/recommend-ride/guest123"

🔹 Deploy on AWS Lambda → Make AI inference serverless & cost-efficient!
